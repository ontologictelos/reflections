# What does it all mean?

## Reflections on Node Template

### Files pushed to Github
- .eslintrc.cjs
- .gitignore
- .prettierignore
- .prettierrc
- package.json

### Why do we need all these?

- Well first what do these all do? Eslint and prettier in essence just help us write better code by giving us settings and configurations that assist us when we make a mistake. But in order to install these we have to have a file for them to live in that’s where .vscode/extensions and .vscode/settings become relevant/ important.
- Just downloading the extensions is not enough though. Or perhaps we won’t be able to use them at all unless we install and use npm.
- With installing npm we get a package.json (super important). I don’t fully understand package.json in what it does specifically but it is something that grounds our work and gives our code rules to follow.
- I am still really unsure what the ignore file does though. From my understanding this just tells git to ignore them so they won’t be pushed or put on GitHub? Why? I don’t know. Do we just not want them on GitHub? Is this a space or size concern or would it sort of break github?
