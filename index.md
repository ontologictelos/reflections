## Reflections on your reflections

### “Programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating”

- Absolutely true on this point, while I haven’t found that this class is maddening there have been evenings working through tailwind where I am working through it and it is just not doing what I want it to do and having to self motivate and talk myself through the problem and goals. Forms for whatever reason are the bane of my coding existence I don’t know why but I spent 2 hours on the form for last weeks tailwind assignment trying to get it to do what I want it to do.

### “A programming language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers”

- This is super interesting considering there is a whole field of philosophy that studies language and how it works. Thus I am interested in this question of how programming languages are made and how they interact with machine language. There is obviously rules and some logic there but there is meaning attached to words, tags and symbols. How does a program translate meaning into machine language? Very interesting question and the answer not only tells us how programming languages are made but also gives insight to how language in general works in real life.

### Thoughts

- There was a small bit on “a program is a building of thought”. This is really interesting language to describe what we see and build on the web as bringing our thoughts and ideas into a tangible experiential thing. In writing there are all these words, grammar, and structures we follow so that our thoughts and ideas are recognizable and understandable to others. In the same way when we think about “best practices” as these sort of rules (the same rules that writers follow) that make our code intelligible to others. As with writers only after mastering the craft of writing can they break these rules and even create new one that translate meaning through writing structure alone. In the same way only when we master these “best practice” rules can programmers (coders, is there a difference?) do/ make interesting things.

## Reflections on JavaScript

### - Is there differing opinions on how we ought to think about JavaScript and ECMA Script?

>"After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language."- Eloquent JavaScript

Within Eloquent JavaScript the author states that JavaScript and ECMA Script are interchangeable. Yet within the mozilla document there is a section detailing with what ECMA is and it seems like a standardization of JavaScript through out the web.

>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript.

Here I see that they use words such as "based". So within mozilla are they talking about languages based on A standardization of JavaScript that has been developed into new languages? It seems logical to follow that there are different versions of the same language? Kind of like old english and modern english and slang?

In any case ECMA is an interesting organization. This idea of standardizing programming languages to have a set of "best practices" that is common within the web. The web becomes (at least behind the curtain) unbiased to a particular countries innovation in programming language making the web a place of uniformity in practice.

### - What is JavaScript?

I found this to be really interesting. I really only know HTML and CSS. I took a into to C# and the term "object oriented programming" was used but wasn't really clear on what this meant.

>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). -Mozilla

#### JavaScript is

1. object-oriented scripting language.
2. A cross-platform language.
3. Can be used (in different forms) in communicating with servers (Node.JS).

When looking into what "object-oriented" meant it lead to some interesting thoughts. Perhaps not thoughts but perhaps differentiation between languages. HTML and CSS are built under different 'orientations' or 'objectives'. While JavaScript is built as a interactive building language. While there is more that can be said here such as talking about "the four pillars" of object oriented programming (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

Through some more research on what JavaScript is it seems that Java is one of the fundamental building languages (alongside HTML & CSS). I would be interested to see how other languages cover these three considering what we can do with these three alone why would we need others? This does assume that every OS understands and recognizes these languages (which they do) but every OS (ios, android, windows) seems to have languages associated with each OS in addition to HTML,CSS, JavaScript.
