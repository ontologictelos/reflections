### **reflections:**

#### Terminal: What it is and how to use it

When asking the question what is the terminal, we cannot really answer that question without talking about why it is preferable than using the gooey. In essence there is not really a difference between the gooey and the terminal they do the same things. BUT, using the terminal is far more efficient. In this way the user can create a file and enter that file add or create changes much faster and with less effort than if the user used the gooey. In another sense using the terminal to update software and or load software is way more efficient than using the gooey. The terminal also uses less power and runs less programs sense it doesn't have to run any graphics or run images.

What the terminal is though with all this in mind is in essence a text based interface with your device that allows you to create files, run programs, and update/ install software. Some synonyms are git bash or warp. I understand these are programs that we use to access the terminal but the terminal is a "place" where we directly talk to the computer and give it instructions.

While in the terminal we execute commands via a prompt, which is just a nerdy term for where you write specific commands that the computer understands. In essence think a google search bar, we type stuff in there and if the search engine recognizes something it fetches and brings it to you. But if you type a query and it doesn't know anything about the search you get a sort of error message. In the same way if I type a command into the prompt the computer does not understand either nothing will happen or I will get an error message.

When thinking of a directory we ought to think basically of the finder icon and opening that and we see a bunch of folders. Translating that into the terminal we can enter a directory giving us access to those folders. For example I have a SWICSpring folder. To access this in the terminal I would use cd SWICSpring and if I typed ls (list command) into the prompt i would see what files are in that directory. cd as a command in essence just tells the terminal i want to move directories from SWICSpring into Web Development directory (going down a level).

#### NPM: [Node Package Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3aKRdUyr0s)

This is kind of complicated and I am not 100% sure I understand what NPM is. But Im all about getting things wrong to better understand what things are (haha philosophy in a nutshell). From my understanding NPM is a "page" that we can go to, to get free open source software that helps us be more effect with our coding. In this way we "buy" the parts for a car and don't have to build the parts from the ground up. From my understanding what we have used it for though is to translate our code for different parts of the web and or to optimize it for certain browsers?

In order for us to use NPM we have to have a [package.json](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xR2nV7MGfE). I am also kind of fuzzy on this. From my understanding package.json in essence lives at the root of our NPM folder and grounds (or anchors) all of our code. Package.json gives our code its rules and identity in a way from my understanding. Package.json is often called the manifest file as it gives a general description of our code.

Installing NPM we just go to our terminal and type "npmi" into the prompt. Through this i believe a package.json is included in npm. While we installed npm and through that package.json we got a tool called vite. Vite is in essence an emulator that shows what our code would look like through a browser. Vite is just a tool that stream lines emulating our css.
