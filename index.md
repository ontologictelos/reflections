1. How do Computers work?

### **reflections:**

It is really cool to see how simplistically complex computers are. I mean just by 1s and 0s we get what we have to day. The philosopher in me can't help but say that computers run on logical principals of really basic if than instructions.

When it comes to bit sizes is it accurate to say that the more bits or bytes a computer has the more complex instructions it can handle?

The electricity example of basic on or off is really helpful as thats just how most of the daily things we use works. I mean with the power logo it basically just shows a diagram of how a light switch works (on is up down is off).

The machine learning section is super interesting. Especially in understanding how we think about coding. That what I am writing is being translated by another set of instructions into 1s and 0s THEN the computer understands what I am telling it to do. I didn't really think of a middle man being part of the process.

When thinking about how small a chip (not sure what specifically he is talking about) is and how bits and or bytes work it makes a lot more sense how technology limits what we can and can not do. But thankfully technology progress so quickly especially in these days.
