## Reflections on JavaScript

### - Is there differing opinions on how we ought to think about JavaScript and ECMA Script?

>"After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language."- Eloquent JavaScript

Within Eloquent JavaScript the author states that JavaScript and ECMA Script are interchangeable. Yet within the mozilla document there is a section detailing with what ECMA is and it seems like a standardization of JavaScript through out the web.

>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript.

Here I see that they use words such as "based". So within mozilla are they talking about languages based on A standardization of JavaScript that has been developed into new languages? It seems logical to follow that there are different versions of the same language? Kind of like old english and modern english and slang?

In any case ECMA is an interesting organization. This idea of standardizing programming languages to have a set of "best practices" that is common within the web. The web becomes (at least behind the curtain) unbiased to a particular countries innovation in programming language making the web a place of uniformity in practice.

### - What is JavaScript?

I found this to be really interesting. I really only know HTML and CSS. I took a into to C# and the term "object oriented programming" was used but wasn't really clear on what this meant.

>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). -Mozilla

#### JavaScript is

1. object-oriented scripting language.
2. A cross-platform language.
3. Can be used (in different forms) in communicating with servers (Node.JS).

When looking into what "object-oriented" meant it lead to some interesting thoughts. Perhaps not thoughts but perhaps differentiation between languages. HTML and CSS are built under different 'orientations' or 'objectives'. While JavaScript is built as a interactive building language. While there is more that can be said here such as talking about "the four pillars" of object oriented programming (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

Through some more research on what JavaScript is it seems that Java is one of the fundamental building languages (alongside HTML & CSS). I would be interested to see how other languages cover these three considering what we can do with these three alone why would we need others? This does assume that every OS understands and recognizes these languages (which they do) but every OS (ios, android, windows) seems to have languages associated with each OS in addition to HTML,CSS, JavaScript.
