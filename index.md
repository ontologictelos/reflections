# **_Reflections_**

### **assignment questions**

1. What is the terminal?
2. Why might we care?
3. What is Git and Github?

#### **reflections:**

When I think about the terminal I typically think of the GUI but more precise. Using the terminal we can do more and be more detailed about the organization of files. We make directories in the terminal which is the equivalent of making a file in the GUI.

It is important to note that there seems to be a difference between the Terminal and the shell. The Shell seems to be a program that is preinstalled on the computer that recognizes a list of commands (ie. flags and arguments). Where as the Terminal is an actual place? Ive also heard that the terminal is more like a UI. With these in mind the Terminal is like a environment you are in and the Shell is the rules that environment obeys/ responds to.

### **Podcast reflections**

Firstly, this podcast makes me feel like i didn't learn anything in my HTML and CSS class. In any case, the first podcast was a great refresher. Through listening to the podcast and even looking up new css code for the about me github assignment they helped me put words to some of the, i guess, theory of css. Especially when we think about elements and containers. Largely when I look at HTML & CSS I just use what I know and if something isn't working I will take to the internet to see how people are accomplishing what i am wanting and through that investigation I will see 10 different ways of doing what I want. Some of what they say I still am not sure what they mean but this is more due to experience, such as "clean HTML" or "clean CSS" as of right now it seems like I just throw the code on there and it works.

Secondly, I really enjoyed the second podcast. The scroll snap feature sounds really cool. I really like to visit coffee shops websites and some of them have this feature and combine it with some cool css and so im excited to try it out some time.

With the CSS motion path, I didn't even know you could do this with CSS. I thought it had to be done with some sort of gif graphic and some Java or some crazy language but with that I am looking forward to trying that out and adding it to my toolbox.
